# AutoGrowPi

**AutoGrowPi** is a passion project created to make growing and monitoring plants indoors easier through automation and webtools.

**AutoGrowPi** is designed for use with the RaspberryPi 4 B board, but can be ported to other Raspberry Pi platforms with minimal effort.

The recommended way to deploy **AutoGrowPi** is to use **BalenaCloud**, so that you can easily scale deployments to multiple machines using their fleet management software.

The monitoring webpage is powered by **Django**.
